=== Listmaker: Mailman List Population from LDAP  =============================

--- Overview ------------------------------------------------------------------

We started out with direct LDAP integration into mailman for a mailing list 
with some 26000 entries but it was problematic at best -- the lookups take 
quite a while and seemed to make the mailman web interface unresponsive.

Listmaker will pull a list of objects from an LDAP directory (using a custom
filter) and diff this list against the current mailman list membership for
a given list.

Configuration is relatively straightforward -- take the example.properties file
and configure up as many lists/directories/etc as you like.  Then make a 
cron job thus:

  ./listmaker -p ~/props.file list-name


NB: You'll need to ensure that whatever bind account you use has no maximum
search limit -- for now listmaker uses no paging of any kind as none was 
available in the target LDAP directory.  Patches welcome!
